# Sidecar Metadata Concept

Sidecar metadata keeps saved mixes inspectable and repairable.

## Important sections

```json
{
  "seed": "...",
  "size": 25,
  "track_count": 25,
  "label": "...",
  "updated_ts": 1770000000,
  "modified_ts": 1770000000,
  "cache_path": "...",
  "mix_parameters": {},
  "consistency": {},
  "repair_readiness": {},
  "discovery": {}
}
```

## Mix parameters

Mix generation parameters are recorded so a saved mix can later explain how it was created.

## Consistency

The consistency section describes missing files and when they were first detected.

## Repair readiness

The repair readiness section records the Kodi library timestamps used to decide whether auto-repair is safe.

## Discovery relation

When a mix is generated from Discovery mode, the seed should be the captured Discovery song at the moment the user selected the action, not whatever happens to play later while the dialog is open.
